Forward velocity of wheel on perfect transmission
  v = w * 2 pi * r
Loading forces
  F_f = m * F_n
  F_s = L * sin(a)
  F_n = m * g * cos(a)
  Ml = (F_f + F_s) * r * C_rf
C_rf is a resistive coeffecity, around 1.1 to 1.15

Wheel moment of Inertia
  I = (1/2) m * r^2

Max transmittable torque is
  T_m = L * m * r

Total Inertia is 
  J = I * a 
a is angular acceleration
