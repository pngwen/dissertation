\chapter*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}
No document is created in a vacuum.  In all literature, there exists
some influencing factor either in the form of cited documents,
collaboration, or documents which authors have read.  This influence
can be seen within their works, and is present as a latent variable.
This dissertation introduces a novel method for quantifying these influences,
and representing them in a semantically understandable fashion.  The
model is constructed by representing documents as tensors, decomposing
them into a set of factors, and then searching the corpus factors for
similarity.
