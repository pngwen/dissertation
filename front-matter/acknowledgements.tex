\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Michael Berry, for his guidance
and encouragement.  I would also like to thank my committee members
Dr. Judy Day, Dr. Bradley Vander Zanden, and Dr. Audris Mockus for all
of their helpful input.  I would also like to thank Ms. Dana Bryson,
without whom the paperwork surrounding the completion of this
dissertation would have simply not been possible.  Last, but certainly
not least, I would like to thank my wife, Erin Lowe.  Without Erin's
encouragement, I would have never gone to graduate school and without
her love and support I certainly would have never succeeded.
